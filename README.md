# Pre-work - *Memory Game*

**Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program. 

Submitted by: **Olaitan Moshood**

Time spent: **#9** hours spent in total

Link to project: ( https://glitch.com/edit/#!/scratch-fixed-becklespinax )     

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [.] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [.] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [.] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [.] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [.] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [.] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [.] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [.] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [.] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [.] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 

[I was getting an error in the console when trying to get my buttons to light up and play their respective pitches]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

[The main challenge I was having when programming this game was the guess function and using the console. First off, I was trying to make the game as original as possible so I tried using my own definitions for the variables but as I progressed through the code it was conflicting a bit since some of the variables given to us and the ones I came up with were colliding and causing issues with my execution, I used the console to help me identify what was going wrong and where it was happening. I was able to solve this issue by working backwards and comparing my originally named variables to the examples given to me and essentially making them match up. This was a mistake and caused a great amount of time to be lost but I did it this way so I could fully understand the code I was working with and actually self identify the issue at hand. When it came to the guess function I was having a little bit of trouble understanding the logic so what I did was use the guess function given to us and started tracing the function so I could basically simulate the code execution step by step and track the values of the variables given to us.]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

[I do not really have any questions about web development, I have a general understanding of the responsibilities held by both front and beack-end developers. I also understand the process and the effort required to make a really good website and/or web application. The logic of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS all make perfect sense to me. JavaScript is how most websites get their functionality, HTML is what gives a website its text, and CSS is how websites get styled (background color, text fonts, button shapes, etc.). I also feel as though if I were required to complete another project along these lines I would definitely be able to come up with something fully functional from scratch.]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

[If I had more time to work on this function I would be spending that time adding additional features because as I work through my code I try to make sure it is as neat and concise as possible, doing this tends to cause me to lose time when it comes to completing all of the code but if I did have extra time I would be using that time to add features to my project since it allows me to hone my skills at coding efficiently, remembering necessary logic, and as well as try out new ways to code certain functions this way I become a much more efficient programmer overall. In terms of adding more features I would definitely try an add a function that allows me to add a game mode where I randomize the number of clues given per turn, this way the game has an entirely  new feel and functionality to it.]
